              ASSIGNMENT 02 

Q11) Write a program in C++ to take an integer from the user and check if it is even or odd.<br>
Q12) Write a program in C++ to input a year from the user and check for leap year.<br>
Q13) Write a program in C++ to create a grade calculator based on the percentage marks obtained. Use "if - else if - else" statements to assign grades like O for 91-100, A for 81-90, B for 71-80, C for 61-70, D for 51-60, E for 41-50, F for 40 and below.<br>
Q14) Write a program in C++ to take three angles as input and determine whether they can form an equilateral, isosceles or scalene triangle.<br>
Q15) Write a program in C++ to take an integer from the user and calculate the factorial.<br>
Q16) Write a program in C++ to take an integer from the user and check whether it is a Palindrome number. Ex: 121; the reverse of a number equals the original number.<br>
Q17) Write a program in C++ to take an integer from the user and check whether it is a Prime number.<br>
Q18) Write a program in C++ to take an integer 'n' from the user and display all the Fibonacci series up to that n-th term.<br>
Q19) Write a program in C++ to take an integer from the user and check whether it is an Armstrong number. Ex: 153; cube(1) + cube(5) + cube(3) = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153 (original number).<br>
